# kcms-generalized
This is the generalized version of kcms for public consumption

KCMS is a generalized version  of the Kaminasan "Content Management System" or KCMS.
It is written using Java Servlets, using JSP for the front end. 

This is produced for general use among the public, and will be updated regularly. It will contain(in the future) a basic copy and go system, where you load it as a library, then copy the bootstrapped web.xml /Servlets into your Web Projects's source folder. 

Then you just run it, and go. 
This is currently in the Alpha stage, and should only be used for very basic scaffolding. Not recommended for use atm. (2016/02/06).
